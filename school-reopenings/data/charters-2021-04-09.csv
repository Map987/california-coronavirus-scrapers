The decision is based on the following: 1) While Kern County is in the red tier, local community case rates are higher than the Kern County average.  As of March 22, 2021, there have been a total of 8,492 cases of COVID reported for our community, or 15.1% of the population, as compared to 11.1% for Kern County. 2) In-person and hybrid instructional schedules place an undue hardship on parents in our agriculturally based community that do not have the flexibility to alter their schedules for mid-day childcare drop-offs or pick-ups. 3) The District is providing a robust distance learning program with live instruction throughout the day and support mechanisms in place to maintain a 98% engagement rate.",DEL VISTA MATH AND SCIENCE ACADEMY - Delano Union Elementary,Yes,No

We believe our Distance Learning program offered provides a more educationally sound instructional model than moving into a hybrid model so late in the year.  
2.	Any new instructional model replacing our currently model will adversely affect our current students.  Time taken to “learn” the needed technology so we have it just right for the fall will only benefit new fall classes.  Current students will lose out on hours of crucial instruction.  We believe this has the potential of creating additional learning loss.
3.	A hybrid model would result in reduced learning time due to operational and instructional demands.  SJCA is a commuter school with the majority of students being driven to school from distances beyond the surrounding neighborhoods.  The potential of parents dropping off and waiting or working from their cars until their children get out of school is a real possibility.  
4.	SJCA is doing a commendable job of establishing supports for our students’ social emotional learning and mental health.   Time and effort have focused on building a community of learners in each classroom.  In addition, a Support Squad has been created to assist students and teachers.  Mental health services have been provided in a variety of ways included family workshops, group counseling, family counseling, and individual counseling opportunities.

We are a small school with minimal staff and resources, so its a tad challenging to reopen over the course of days. We are basically going to offer 3 programs, 1. hybrid onsite k-3  2. cohorts for 4th-8th and 3. 100% online.

So we needed to rearrange teachers to support the onsite program as our support staff managers the cohorts while the teachers teach virtually. We have worked with a teacher planning team to support the idea generation of reopening, as we need their support with rearrange teachers to try to support our parents needs, whether onsite or at home.

The other big challenge is the competitiveness of the supply chain, we do not have big buying power as a single site Charter school. When we ordered our Chromebooks, its took 6 months to get the inventory, order was placed in June and we received inventory in Nov 2020.  We have a great relationship with the neighboring Charter that allowed us use of their Chrombooks to get our students connected. Air purifiers are taking 9 weeks, our building doesn't have windows, and hybrid technology is taking about a month or so. We have looked at technology to support hybrid classes since Oct 2020, which each product had pros and cons, and our goal being a student centered approach. We expect to receive both of those items in early April, during our Spring break. So if we wanted to try to force ourselves to reopen by April 1st, we would have the tools needed in place to be ready to bring students back.

All of the counties in which SIATech has school sites located, were in the state’s purple tier until very recently.  One county (Santa Clara) moved to the red tier earlier this month, and plans are currently underway to begin partial in-person instruction at the San Jose site by early April.  Another site, San Diego, opened for in-person instruction on a very limited basis, when that county was in the red tier.  Plans for expanding in-person instruction at that site were hindered by the county moving back into the purple tier and alarmingly increasing infection rates across the state.   In addition to the majority of its sites still being in counties that are in the purple tier, another barrier or challenge that SIATech faces is that all of its classroom based programs are in partnership with the Federal Job Corps programs and they are co-located at the Job Corps facilities.  As the Job Corps bring back cohorts of students back on their centers, SIATech is then better able to serve the students who are also enrolled in its programs.  All SIATech sites are expected to fully return to in-person instruction by May 17, 2021, at the latest, as the counties transition to the red tier and as the Job Corps centers bring more students back onto their centers.

As mentioned above, students are currently assigned to attend classes virtually. Our students and teachers may not be attached to the same resource center. By switching these classes from virtual to in-person, some students may need to arrange for transportation of up to 150+/- miles round trip.

We are a non-classroom based independent study program. Many of our students follow the home school model. Pre-COVID, we offered classes at our resource centers as well as virtually via MS Teams. When the pandemic hit and the governor issued stay at home orders, we converted all our classes to a virtual model via MS Teams and completed 2019-20 school year with all student/teacher meetings and classes conducted virtually.  As school year 2020-21 began with shelter in place orders still intact, we made the decision to return to our fully virtual model for the entire 2020-21 school year for all classes. Students from our three different resource centers were enrolled in classes that met their individual needs - rather than restricting students to geographic constraints.  If we returned to in-person instruction during the school year, we would have students that would not be able to attend class meetings due to transportation issues. In-person instruction between students and their teachers has been an available option since October 2020.
