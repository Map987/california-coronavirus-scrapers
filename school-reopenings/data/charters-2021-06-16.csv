We determined that teachers in grades 3-5 could not effectively serve students in both a hybrid and distance learning only program so we gave our families the option of either remaining in a distance only learning environment, or to be on campus where students would benefit from social interactions with their peers and staff  but be served by Instructional Assistance in learning hubs. This format worked well for the vast majority of our families so we selected this option.

Storage space for PPE, extra furniture, school equipment, and other items that will need to be stored in order to meet the protocols related to social distancing, in schools with limited storage capacity.
Unforeseen costs to schools that are now being funded for covid related costs.  There is always an underlying cost that is not computed into the funding for covid (i.e. increased health group insurance rates due to impacts on the health industry related to response to covid and related illnesses). 
The effect of possible staff shortages because staff must leave the school site and not report to work if they are ill whether covid related or not. 
The effect of possible low attendance numbers because students will need to stay home or go home if they are ill, whether covid related or not.  
More sick days experienced from staff and students.
Loss of many school activities like field trips due to social distancing, many venues are not open to the public and only limited numbers can enter venues that opened.

CNCA campuses are located in communities with volatile COVID case and deaths rates, a lack of access to general healthcare, and families who have overwhelmingly expressed hesitation to begin on-site instruction without consistent vaccine access. Our schools have gained positive traction in our distance learning program over the last 8 months, and we plan to continue implementation until the end of the 2020-2021 school year. Beginning in mid-April, we will open campuses for on-site technology and student supports to serve subgroups with the highest needs.

Our schools have gained positive traction in our distance learning program over the last 8 months, and we plan to continue implementation until the end of the 2020-2021 school year.

We believe our Distance Learning program offered provides a more educationally sound instructional model than moving into a hybrid model so late in the year.  
2.	Any new instructional model replacing our currently model will adversely affect our current students.  Time taken to “learn” the needed technology so we have it just right for the fall will only benefit new fall classes.  Current students will lose out on hours of crucial instruction.  We believe this has the potential of creating additional learning loss.
3.	A hybrid model would result in reduced learning time due to operational and instructional demands.  SJCA is a commuter school with the majority of students being driven to school from distances beyond the surrounding neighborhoods.  The potential of parents dropping off and waiting or working from their cars until their children get out of school is a real possibility.  
4.	SJCA is doing a commendable job of establishing supports for our students’ social emotional learning and mental health.   Time and effort have focused on building a community of learners in each classroom.  In addition, a Support Squad has been created to assist students and teachers.  Mental health services have been provided in a variety of ways included family workshops, group counseling, family counseling, and individual counseling opportunities.

SIATech partners with the Federal Job Corps program at all of its classroom-based locations. Currently each Job Corps center is in the process of returning small cohorts of students to their facilities, who have been tested and cleared for COVID-19. As students are reintegrated back to campus life, the SIATech principal at each location will work with the lead administrator of each Job Corps center, to ensure that all returning students receive optimal academic support from SIATech staff. 100% of the staff are now back at all of SIATech’s school sites.

As mentioned above, students are currently assigned to attend classes virtually. Our students and teachers may not be attached to the same resource center. By switching these classes from virtual to in-person, some students may need to arrange for transportation of up to 150+/- miles round trip. The decision was made to keep these virtual classes intact through the end of this school year.

We are a non-classroom based independent study program. Many of our students follow the home school model. Pre-COVID, we offered classes at our resource centers as well as virtually via MS Teams. When the pandemic hit and the governor issued stay at home orders, we converted all our classes to a virtual model via MS Teams and completed 2019-20 school year with all student/teacher meetings and classes conducted virtually.  As school year 2020-21 began with shelter in place orders still intact, we made the decision to return to our fully virtual model for the entire 2020-21 school year for all classes. Students from our three different resource centers were enrolled in classes that met their individual needs - rather than restricting students to geographic constraints.  If we returned to in-person instruction during the school year, we would have students that would not be able to attend class meetings due to transportation issues. In-person instruction between students and their teachers has been an available option since October 2020.
