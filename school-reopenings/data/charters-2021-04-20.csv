Expand hub capacity (A hub is a cohort of students who are on-site in a room with social distancing, and who are learning online and receiving in-person and online supervision.)
a.	Add a cohort of 12 students for each of the eight grade levels to prepare for part-time, in-person, on-site instruction.

In preparation to offer part-time, in-person, on-site instruction RCP created a reopening committee. The reopening committee compiled a plethora of documents which will be followed for the remainder of the 2020-21 school year. The committee is now developing seven new cohorts to add to the two we already have and compiling class rosters for them (one for 3rd grade, two for 2nd, 4th, and 6th-grades). We will also post the required Safety Plan on the RCP website. 
RCP is in the red tier and will offer part-time, in-person, on-site instruction for nine cohorts of 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th-grade students and students with identified needs. Students will meet in-person Monday through Thursday and online on Fridays. All other students will continue to study online full-time.
2.	Ensure that each classroom has adequate technology to support teachers delivering instruction on-site, in-person, and remotely.

To prepare for reopening, each classroom has been equipped with additional adequate technology to support on-site, in-person instruction. Additionally, RCP has purchased all the necessary personal protective equipment to ensure the safety of students, staff, and families. 

3.	Ensure RCP is adequately staffed to offer on-site, in-person classes by adding the following staff: 
a.	Recess Monitor (Possibly Instructional Assistants)
b.	Bathroom Monitor (Possibly Instructional Assistants)
c.	Full-time Mental Health counselor on-site to meet with students and families
d.	COVID Testing Coordinator 

We have assigned staff to monitor recess and bathroom breaks. We have one full-time Mental Health counselor, and we are working on hiring an additional Mental Health counselor. RCP’s Family and Community Engagement Coordinator and our Administrative Assistant will coordinate the COVID testing.

We decided to contract an outside laboratory to conduct and process the COVID-19 testing of students and staff. We are now in the process of signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with a laboratory.

4. Ensure we purchase the necessary tents and tables to support outside lunch

Instead of outside lunches, our in-person students will be provided with grab-and-go lunches Monday through Friday. The canopies we have purchased canopies will support student arrivals and departures. They will be set up right before opening day, April 19, 2021. We have also scheduled for the school meals to be delivered by our provider.  

5. Address health and safety concerns by implementing COVID testing to minimize RCP’s liability 
a.	Contract a lab that will process the tests for RCP

We requested information from different laboratories which can conduct and process bi-monthly COVID-19 testing for students and staff. We are now in the process of signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with a laboratory.

6. Mitigate learning loss by offering Saturday School by April 15th and Summer School by July 1, 2021 

Our plan is now definite: RCP will offer Saturday School starting April 17th through June 12, 2021, and Summer School June 28th through July 23, 2021. The Family and Community Engagement Coordinator has developed class rosters for each grade level for the Saturday School.

B.	All staff not vaccinated, and their priority is not yet confirmed as to when they will be vaccinated.  
C.	Staff members who are reluctant or refuse to be vaccinated.
D.	Storage space for PPE, extra furniture, school equipment, and other items that will need to be stored in order to meet the protocols related to social distancing, in schools with limited storage capacity.
E.	Unforeseen costs to schools that are now being funded for covid related costs.  There is always an underlying cost that is not computed into the funding for covid (i.e. increased health group insurance rates due to impacts on the health industry related to response to covid and related illnesses). 
F.	The effect of possible staff shortages because staff must leave the school site and not report to work if they are ill whether covid related or not. 
G.	The effect of possible low attendance numbers because students will need to stay home or go home if they are ill, whether covid related or not.  
H.	More sick days experienced from staff and students.
I.	Loss of many school activities like field trips due to social distancing, many venues are not open to the public and only limited numbers can enter venues that opened. 
J.	Refusal by parents/guardians to follow the preventive procedures and protocols at the school site.  How to reinforce parental/guardian compliance within the law.

We believe our Distance Learning program offered provides a more educationally sound instructional model than moving into a hybrid model so late in the year.  
2.	Any new instructional model replacing our currently model will adversely affect our current students.  Time taken to “learn” the needed technology so we have it just right for the fall will only benefit new fall classes.  Current students will lose out on hours of crucial instruction.  We believe this has the potential of creating additional learning loss.
3.	A hybrid model would result in reduced learning time due to operational and instructional demands.  SJCA is a commuter school with the majority of students being driven to school from distances beyond the surrounding neighborhoods.  The potential of parents dropping off and waiting or working from their cars until their children get out of school is a real possibility.  
4.	SJCA is doing a commendable job of establishing supports for our students’ social emotional learning and mental health.   Time and effort have focused on building a community of learners in each classroom.  In addition, a Support Squad has been created to assist students and teachers.  Mental health services have been provided in a variety of ways included family workshops, group counseling, family counseling, and individual counseling opportunities.

All of the counties in which SIATech has school sites located, were in the state’s purple tier until very recently.  One county (Santa Clara) moved to the red tier earlier this month, and plans are currently underway to begin partial in-person instruction at the San Jose site by early April.  Another site, San Diego, opened for in-person instruction on a very limited basis, when that county was in the red tier.  Plans for expanding in-person instruction at that site were hindered by the county moving back into the purple tier and alarmingly increasing infection rates across the state.   In addition to the majority of its sites still being in counties that are in the purple tier, another barrier or challenge that SIATech faces is that all of its classroom based programs are in partnership with the Federal Job Corps programs and they are co-located at the Job Corps facilities.  As the Job Corps bring back cohorts of students back on their centers, SIATech is then better able to serve the students who are also enrolled in its programs.  All SIATech sites are expected to fully return to in-person instruction by May 17, 2021, at the latest, as the counties transition to the red tier and as the Job Corps centers bring more students back onto their centers.

As mentioned above, students are currently assigned to attend classes virtually. Our students and teachers may not be attached to the same resource center.

Pre-COVID, we offered classes at our resource centers as well as virtually via MS Teams. When the pandemic hit and the governor issued stay at home orders, we converted all our classes to a virtual model via MS Teams and completed 2019-20 school year with all student/teacher meetings and classes conducted virtually.  As school year 2020-21 began with shelter in place orders still intact, we made the decision to return to our fully virtual model for the entire 2020-21 school year for all classes. Students from our three different resource centers were enrolled in classes that met their individual needs - rather than restricting students to geographic constraints.  If we returned to in-person instruction during the school year, we would have students that would not be able to attend class meetings due to transportation issues. In-person instruction between students and their teachers has been an available option since October 2020.
