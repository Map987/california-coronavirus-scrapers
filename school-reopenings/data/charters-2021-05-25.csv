We determined that teachers in grades 3-5 could not effectively serve students in both a hybrid and distance learning only program so we gave our families the option of either remaining in a distance only learning environment, or to be on campus where students would benefit from social interactions with their peers and staff  but be served by Instructional Assistance in learning hubs. This format worked well for the vast majority of our families so we selected this option.

CNCA campuses are located in communities with volatile COVID case and deaths rates, a lack of access to general healthcare, and families who have overwhelmingly expressed hesitation to begin on-site instruction without consistent vaccine access. Our schools have gained positive traction in our distance learning program over the last 8 months, and we plan to continue implementation until the end of the 2020-2021 school year. Beginning in mid-April, we will open campuses for on-site technology and student supports to serve subgroups with the highest needs.

CNCA campuses are located in communities with volatile COVID case and deaths rates, a lack of access to general healthcare, and families who have overwhelmingly expressed hesitation to begin on-site instruction without consistent vaccine access. Our schools have gained positive traction in our distance learning program over the last 8 months, and we plan to continue implementation until the end of the 2020-2021 school year. Beginning in mid-April, we will open campuses for on-site technology and student supports to serve subgroups with the highest needs.

We believe our Distance Learning program offered provides a more educationally sound instructional model than moving into a hybrid model so late in the year.  
2.	Any new instructional model replacing our currently model will adversely affect our current students.  Time taken to “learn” the needed technology so we have it just right for the fall will only benefit new fall classes.  Current students will lose out on hours of crucial instruction.  We believe this has the potential of creating additional learning loss.
3.	A hybrid model would result in reduced learning time due to operational and instructional demands.  SJCA is a commuter school with the majority of students being driven to school from distances beyond the surrounding neighborhoods.  The potential of parents dropping off and waiting or working from their cars until their children get out of school is a real possibility.  
4.	SJCA is doing a commendable job of establishing supports for our students’ social emotional learning and mental health.   Time and effort have focused on building a community of learners in each classroom.  In addition, a Support Squad has been created to assist students and teachers.  Mental health services have been provided in a variety of ways included family workshops, group counseling, family counseling, and individual counseling opportunities.

Many of our students follow the home school model. Pre-COVID, we offered classes at our resource centers as well as virtually via MS Teams. When the pandemic hit and the governor issued stay at home orders, we converted all our classes to a virtual model via MS Teams and completed 2019-20 school year with all student/teacher meetings and classes conducted virtually.  As school year 2020-21 began with shelter in place orders still intact, we made the decision to return to our fully virtual model for the entire 2020-21 school year for all classes. Students from our three different resource centers were enrolled in classes that met their individual needs - rather than restricting students to geographic constraints.  If we returned to in-person instruction during the school year, we would have students that would not be able to attend class meetings due to transportation issues. In-person instruction between students and their teachers has been an available option since October 2020.
